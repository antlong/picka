To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
In his eyes she eclipses predominates the whole of her sex.
It was not that he felt emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind.
He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a he would have placed himself in a false position.
He never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer.
They admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the from mens motives and actions.
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power
lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him and
that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable
memory.

I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
away from each other. My own complete happiness and the
home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to
absorb all my attention while Holmes who loathed every form of
society with his whole Bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in
Baker Street buried among his old books and alternating from
week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the
drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still
as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his
immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which
had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
to time I heard some vague account of his doings of his summons
to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee
and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
Beyond these signs of his activity however which I merely
shared with all the readers of the daily press I knew little of
my former friend and companion.

One night it was on the twentieth of March 1888 I was
returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
civil practice) when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
passed the well-remembered door which must always be associated
in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the
Study in Scarlet I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
His rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up I saw
his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head
sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me who
knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their
own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was but he was glad I
think to see me. With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly
eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars
and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
introspective fashion.

Wedlock suits you he remarked. I think Watson that you have
put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.

Seven! I answered.

Indeed I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more
I fancy Watson. And in practice again I observe. You did not
tell me that you intended to go into harness.

Then how do you know?

I see it I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and
careless servant girl?

My dear Holmes said I this is too much. You would certainly
have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
mess but as I have changed my clothes I cant imagine how you
deduce it. As to Mary Jane she is incorrigible and my wife has
given her notice but there again I fail to see how you work it
out.

He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands
together.

It is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the
inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it
the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile
weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice if a
gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black
mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
his stethoscope I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce
him to be an active member of the medical profession.

I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. When I hear you give your reasons I
remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
simple that I could easily do it myself though at each
successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
as yours.

Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing
himself down into an armchair. You see but you do not observe.
The distinction is clear. For example you have frequently seen
the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.

Frequently.

How often?

Well some hundreds of times.

Then how many are there?

How many? I dont know.

Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
just my point. Now I know that there are seventeen steps
because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way since you are
interested in these little problems and since you are good
enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you
may be interested in this. He threw over a sheet of thick
pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
It came by the last post said he. Read it aloud.

The note was undated and without either signature or address.

There will call upon you to-night at a quarter to eight
oclock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour and do
not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.

This is indeed a mystery I remarked. What do you imagine that
it means?

I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
theories instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
What do you deduce from it?

I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was
written.

The man who wrote it was presumably well to do I remarked
endeavouring to imitate my companions processes. Such paper
could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
strong and stiff.

Peculiar that is the very word said Holmes. It is not an
English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.

I did so and saw a large E with a small g a P and a
large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.

What do you make of that? asked Holmes.

The name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather.

Not at all. The G with the small t stands for
Gesellschaft which is the German for Company. It is a
customary contraction like our Co. P of course stands for
Papier. Now for the Eg. Let us glance at our Continental
Gazetteer. He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
Eglow Eglonitz here we are Egria. It is in a German-speaking
country in Bohemia not far from Carlsbad. Remarkable as being
the scene of the death of Wallenstein and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills. Ha ha my boy what do you
make of that? His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue
triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

The paper was made in Bohemia I said.

Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
note the peculiar construction of the sentence This account of
you we have from all quarters received. A Frenchman or Russian
could not have written that. It is the German who is so
uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains therefore to discover
what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes if
I am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts.

As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and
grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the
bell. Holmes whistled.

A pair by the sound said he. Yes he continued glancing
out of the window. A nice little brougham and a pair of
